<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
  Leeds.dart is a user group that meets in Leeds on the first Wednesday
  of every other month. We aim to create a community of Dart developers
  in Yorkshire and provide knowledgeable and informative talks about the
  Dart language and various Dart projects.</p>

<h3>What makes Dart so great?</h3>
<p>Dart offers a super tight development stack with great libraries and
  tools. Dart has a pure native version of the incredible
  <a href="https://angulardart.org/" target="_NEW">Angular2</a> framework.
  With <a href="https://flutter.io/" target="_NEW">Flutter</a> you can develop
  super slick cross-platform mobile apps. You can write server-side and
  client-side apps in Dart. The Dart language is familiar and predictable.
  Come join us and find out more reasons for yourself! If you're looking for
  more information about the Dart language then head over to the official
  <a href="https://www.dartlang.org" target="_NEW">dartlang</a> website.</p>

<h3>Join our chat</h3>
<p>We've got a leeds.dart
  <a href="https://gitter.im/leeds-dart/Lobby" target="_NEW">Gitter channel</a>
  so come on over and say hello! :)</p>
